# MATH319 Group Project: Secure Photo Gallery Application
This is a project for MATH319 course. Full information is in [this pdf file](./Math319%20assignment%202024_Semester2.pdf). Our project idea to make a secure photo gallery application using python. Users are able to store their images securly and retrieve them.

# Status: Completed âœ…
The application successfully meets all project constraints. We have documented our process in a [report](./report.pdf) and [presented](./presentaion.pdf) our work, and we got full marks for the project.

# Features 
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to securely manage their photos.
- **Photo Upload**: Users can upload images that are automatically encrypted before storage.
- **AES Encryption**: Images are encrypted using the AES cryptosystem to ensure data privacy.
- **Decryption for Viewing**: Users can view their images, which are decrypted on-the-fly when accessed.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface for user interactions.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- Cryptography (for AES encryption)
- HTML/CSS (for the frontend)

# Skills Gained
Through the development of this project, we gained practical experience in:

- Implementing AES encryption and decryption in Python.
- Utilizing Django for web application development.
- Understanding user authentication and session management.
- Managing file uploads and handling binary data securely.
- Designing a user-friendly interface for web applications.
