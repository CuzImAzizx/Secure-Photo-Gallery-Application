# MATH319 Group Project: Secure Photo Gallery Application
This is a project for MATH319 course. Full information is in [this pdf file](./Math319%20assignment%202024_Semester2.pdf). Our project idea to make a secure photo gallery application using python. Users are able to store their images securly and retrieve them.

## Status: incomplete ⏳❌
The current app is functional. The users are able to create an accounts, login, upload their images, and view their stored images. But the **crucial step** is to encrypt the stored images, and decrypted them when retrieved.

### Projet constraint:
Our project should satisfy the following constraints. Satisfied constraints are stroked:
- ~~User Interface~~
- ~~User Authentication~~
- ~~Photo Upload~~
- AES Encryption
- Retrieval and Decryption
---

### TODOs
Here are the next steps we should achieve in the next period:
#### 1- Encrypt the stored images
The app now stores the images as they are. They should be encrypted using the AES algorithm, and be decrypted when retrieved

#### 2- Enhance the UI/UX
Build a better UI for the app, with appropiate error messages.

#### 3- Validation
Validate the inputs for registration, login, and uploading.
