# MATH319 Group Project: Secure Photo Gallery Application
This is a project for MATH319 course. Full information is in [this pdf file](./Math319%20assignment%202024_Semester2.pdf). Our project idea to make a secure photo gallery application using python. Users are able to store their images securly and retrieve them.

## Status: Semi-complete ⏳✅
The app now is satisfying the project's constraints and it's acceptable. But we gotta make a few changes to enhance it and to make it perfect. Also we gotta make the report for it.

### Projet constraint: FULLY SATISFIED ✅
Our project should satisfy the following constraints. Satisfied constraints are stroked:
- ~~User Interface~~
- ~~User Authentication~~
- ~~Photo Upload~~
- ~~AES Encryption~~
- ~~Retrieval and Decryption~~
---

### TODOs
Here are the next steps we should achieve in the next period:
#### 1- ~~Encrypt the stored images~~ COMPLETED ✅
The app now stores the images as they are. They should be encrypted using the AES algorithm, and be decrypted when retrieved

#### 2- ~~Enhance the UI/UX~~ COMPLETED ✅
Build a better UI for the app, with appropiate error messages.

#### 3- Validation
Validate the inputs for registration, login, and uploading. 

#### 4- Few modification on the UI
Simple changes on the UI such as buttons locations

#### 5- Logout 
Add a route and logic for logout

#### 6- Code clean up
There are so many unused codes and useless comments. Gotta clean that sh1t up and make the code readable

#### 7- Report
Write a report for the project.
